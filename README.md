### Notes
Describe any challenges encountered while building the app.
Both aspects of the required functionality were completed when I submitted Sunday evening and I did not understand the readme template aspects of assignments until I spoke with TA's yesterday. I had been just adding the gif to the basic readme files and didn't see anything wrong. I now understand why I only got 50% as the initial grade because my subpar initial gif did not show I had completed both required tasks.
